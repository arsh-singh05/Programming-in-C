# Programming-in-C

This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises in the C programming language. C is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that is widely used for developing operating systems, compilers, and other applications that require low-level access to system resources.

This repository mainly has all my first year Computer Programming codes at BITS Pilani.

The *some other codes* file includes codes that are generally asked in assessments

If you have any suggestions or improvements for the projects and exercises in this repository, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue. Contributions are welcome!
